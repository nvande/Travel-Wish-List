# Travel Wish List

The Travel Wish List application generates a randomized list of 10 countries, and allows you to sort and remove countries from this list as well as take notes, so you will be ready to plan your next globe-spanning adventure.

### `npm start`

Runs the app.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Configuration

You can edit `config.json` to modify configuration for the app:
* `apiUrl` determines the URL of the API to gather country information from
* `numberOfCountries` lets you control how many countries to generate with each new list (up to 99 before overflow becomes a problem)
